# Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi - Milestone 1

## üìå Overview
This project is a milestone-based implementation of **Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi**, a simplified version of the Japanese chess variant, **Shogi**. Our goal is to implement a Java-based version of the game following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Implement core game mechanics based on **Goro-Goro Dobutsu Shogi**.
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for high-quality code.
- Maintain clean, modular, and maintainable Java code.
- Submit the project as a **website URL**.

## üèÜ Game Rules
- **Board:** 5√ó6 grid.
- **Pieces:** Each player starts with 8 pieces - 1 lion, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 3 chicks.
- **Movement:** Pieces move one space in any direction (orthogonal or diagonal).
- **Capturing:** Players can move onto an opponent‚Äôs piece to capture it.
- **Piece Dropping:** Captured pieces can be placed back onto the board.
- **Restrictions:** Players cannot move their pieces onto their own pieces.

### ‚ùå **Not Included in Milestone 1**
- **Promotion** of chicks and cats.
- **Winner logic** and endgame conditions.
- **Complex move mechanics** (e.g., checkmate rules, repeat moves).
- **Multiple chicks on the same rank.**
